# Practice Problems
  
  ## Infix, Postfix, Prefix
  Normally we see mathematical expressions written with the operator acting between the operands (ie. 2 + 2, 15 / 3, 3 * (x - 4), etc). This convention is called infix notation where a operator(p) acts between the surrounding operands (d) -> d p d. Prefix notation is when the operator comes before its two operands p d d (ie. / 4 2, * 8 6, - 9 (+ x 4), etc). Lastly a postfix expression occurs when the operator comes after the two operands d d p (ie. 4 2 /, 8 6 *, 9 (x 4 +) -, etc). Below are examples on how to convert between the notations...
  
  ### Evaluating Expressions
  1) Evaluate the

  ### Conversion between Expressions (ie. Infix -> Prefix, Postfix -> Prefix)
  1) Infix to Prefix
   ```
   AX2 + BX + C = 0
  ```
  2) Postfix to Prefix
   ```
   A A B + C A B / - / * 
  ```
